Knocked Up

CHARLOTTE	Sadie, wake up.
SADIE	Oh my gosh.
CHARLOTTE	Daddy, wake up.
PETE	Okay, I'm up.
DEBBIE	I need you to take the kids to school this morning.
PETE	Oh, I would, but I'm supposed to work out.
DEBBIE	What?
PETE	I got an appointment with a trainer. I can't cancel now, he'll charge me.
DEBBIE	Well, you didn't tell me.
PETE	Yeah I did. Last week, I told you.
DEBBIE	You didn't tell me.
PETE	I did. And then I wrote it on the calendar like you told me to.
DEBBIE	No, you didn't tell me.
PETE	I did tell you.
DEBBIE	Well, you didn't, but what are we going to do? Because I have an appointment so you're taking the kids to school.
DEBBIE	Don't use the baby to cover your tracks.
ALISON	I can drive them. I'll drive them to school.
PETE	Thank you very much.
DEBBIE	Great. Good. You turned my sister into a limo driver.
ALISON	I don't mind.
PETE	It all worked out!
ALISON	What are you giggling about?
SADIE	Be quiet. You're starting to annoy me.
CHARLOTTE	Poo poo.
ALISON	Ladies. Nice.
SADIE	You know what I did the other day?
ALISON	What?
SADIE	I Googled "murder."
ALISON	You Googled "murder?"
SADIE	Yeah.
ALISON	Why? I mean what did it say?
SADIE	It didn't say anything. It just showed pictures of people lying dead on the floor and...blood everywhere and ugh...
ALISON	That was just ketchup. Who wants to hear some music?
SADIE	I want to hear "Rent."
CHARLOTTE	I want to hear Green Day!
SADIE	No, we're listening to "Rent."
CHARLOTTE	Well, I want to listen to Green Day.
SADIE	Well, I got your baby!
ALISON	Don't taunt her. Come on.
SADIE	Here.
ALISON	Sadie!
CHARLOTTE	Ow!
ALISON	Why did you just do that? Don't throw things at your sister!
CHARLOTTE	She hit me.
ALISON	Did you hit her?
SADIE	I did not.
ALISON	Make her happy. It's okay.
SADIE	It won't make her happy. She spilled all the marbles on the floor.
ALISON	Well, give her her marbles back.

JONAH	Aw, she's not famous.
JASON	"Damn it, Cohaagen, give the people the air."
RYAN SEACREST	So if you want that perfect tan like the stars, he's the one to see. We'll be right back on "E! News." Stay with us.
ALISON	(into her headset) Okay.
RYAN SEACREST	Okay, is Jessica Simpson here yet?

JILL	Alison?
ALISON	Yeah?
JILL	Jack and I need to see you in his office.
JACK	Thanks for coming in, Alison. Well, we wanted to talk to you today because we had a little debate on the conference call with New York about you.
ALISON	You were talking about me?
JACK	We were wondering aloud to one another whether or not you would be good for on-camera.
ALISON	What'd you decide?
JILL	They decided that they like you. And they would like to put you on camera.
ALISON	Really?

JILL	You know, by, by eating less. We would just like it if you...go home and step on the scale and write down how much you weigh and subtract it by, like, twenty.
ALISON	Twenty.
JILL	And then weigh that much.
JACK	Just remember, you've got it here, you've got it here, and everybody's going see you right there.
DEBBIE	Yay! That's so exciting!
ALISON	Yay!
DEBBIE	Oh my god! Hey!
PETE	Huh?
ALISON	I got a promotion.
PETE	Oh, congratulations!
ALISON	Thank you.
PETE	Hey, maybe you can get your own place now.
ALISON	Oh, let's not get ahead of ourselves. Yay!
DEBBIE	Let's go celebrate.
ALISON	Okay, let's do it.
DEBBIE	Pete'll watch the kids?
PETE	Yeah! We can watch "Taxicab Confessions."
DEBBIE	What are you going to do?
ALISON	I don't know!
DEBBIE	I'm so excited.
ALISON	Yay!
DEBBIE	I walked in on him masturbating one night.
ALISON	Ooh! Did you get the deer-in-the- headlights look? Did he freeze or did he finish?
DEBBIE	No, he tried to pretend like he wasn't doing anything under the covers.
ALISON	Oh, no!
DEBBIE	I buy these nice towels and he whacks off into them.
ALISON	"Deb and Pete forever"
DEBBIE	And once he does that into them once, they're never soft ever again.
DEBBIE	I can always tell if I'm looking good based on whether or not we get in.
BOUNCER	Ladies?
ALISON	Guess we're looking good.
DEBBIE	If I didn't get in, I would have lost my shit.
BEN	What's going on man? How long you gonna make us wait out here, for Christ's sake?
JAY	Come on! What the fuck!
BEN	You know what movie I just saw again the other day which is fucking, like, mind-blowing, and I haven't seen it since it came out? "Munich."
JAY	"Munich!"
JONAH	Dude, "Munich" fuckin' rules.
JAY	"Munich" is awesome!
BEN	That movie was Eric Bana kicking fuckin' ass!
BEN	Dude, every movie with Jews, we're the ones getting killed. "Munich" flips it on its ear. We cappin' motherfuckers.
JONAH	Not only killing, but fuckin', like, takin' names.
BEN	If any of us get laid tonight, it's because of Eric Bana in "Munich."
JONAH	I agree with that.
JAY	I agree.
BEN	You know what is not helping us get laid? Is the shoe bomber, Richard Reid, over here at our table. I like your shoes.
JONAH	How was "Burning Man" this year?
BEN	Fuck you guys, I'm glad I'm not Jewish.
BEN	So are we.
MARTIN	Fine. Screw it.
BEN	You weren't "chosen" for a reason.
JAY	Yeah. Ahh!
JASON	Ohh!!!
DEBBIE	It's like everyone in here is twelve years old.
DEBBIE	Am I too old to be here?
ALISON	What?
DEBBIE	Am I too old to be here?
ALISON	No, of course not.
DEBBIE	Does it look weird that I'm here?
ALISON	No, not at all.
DEBBIE	Am I hotter than these little bitches?
ALISON	Yes! You look amazing.
DEBBIE	Guys in here would fuck me, right?
ALISON	Yes.
DEBBIE	That's weird to say, but, it makes me feel better.
ALISON	You look hot.
DEBBIE	I believe you.
ALISON	I'm getting us drinks.
BEN	Yo, a beer over here, please? You're gonna be embarrassed when you realize I'm Wilmer Valderrama. God.
ALISON	(to the Bartender) Oh, Hey! Excuse me!
BEN	He's literally ignoring this entire half of the bar. Don't even bother.
ALISON	Yeah, awesome.
BEN	A beer over here, please? He looked at us! Did you see that?
ALISON	Yeah, that was rough.
BEN	And if you can't get service, what am I gonna do, you know?
ALISON	Great. It's going to be that night.
BEN	Okay, you want a beer?
ALISON	Yeah.
BEN	Just observe.
BARTENDER	Come on, man!
BEN	Here you go! For your trouble! Thank you. BEN (CONT'D) (cont'd) There you go.
ALISON	Thank you.
BEN	Okay, enjoy it.
ALISON	Are you sure?
BEN	I'm sure. I tried that once before at The Comedy Store and I got punched in the ear.
ALISON	Thanks a lot, Oh, fuck, fuck! I'm supposed to get one for my sister.
BEN	Oh, here, take mine.
ALISON	No, that's okay. I'll wait. I'll, he'll get me--
BEN	Please, I very rarely look cool. This is a big moment for me. Just take it.
ALISON	Thank you. Awesome.
BEN	No problem.
ALISON	I'm Alison.
BEN	I'm Ben.
ALISON	Well, have a great night.
BEN	Okay, you too. Have a--
ALISON	Thanks for the beer.
BEN	Okay, enjoy, be nice to them.
ALISON	Bye. Thanks again.
BEN	I'll see ya later. No, I won't, `cause I'm a pussy.
JASON	What's up, daddy?
BEN	That girl. She, she totally gave me an opening, man, and I locked up. I just want to get shit-faced, though, you know? I'll just jerk it later. It's cool.
JASON	Are you fuckin' crazy, man? She looks...smart. Who's that she's sitting with?
BEN	It's her sister.
JASON	Her sister?
BEN	Yeah.
JASON	Dude, it's the dream. What are we doin' standing here man? Let's go. Come on, follow me. You stay here.
MARTIN	Why?
JASON	`Cause your face looks like a vagina.
MARTIN	Dick!
JASON	Hey, which one's the sister?
JONAH	Hey, Crockett. You still partyin' with Tubbs these days?
MARTIN	Come on, man. I'm getting it from all angles here. I don't like it anymore.
JONAH	I know, I don't either. Was it weird when you changed your name from Cat Stevens to Yusuf Islam?
MARTIN	Yeah, it was really awkward.
JONAH	All right, man. I got to take off. See ya, "Scorsese on coke."
MARTIN	What's that?
JAY	Chewbacca. It's, you know, it's Chewie.
MARTIN	Oh, another beard joke.
JAY	Fuck.
MARTIN	Fuckin' hilarious!
BEN	Hey.
ALISON	Hey.
BEN	Hi, this is my friend, Jason. I just wanted to see how my beers were doin'.
ALISON	This is my sister, Debbie.
BEN	Oh, hi, I'm Ben.
DEBBIE	Hi, Ben?
BEN	Yes.
DEBBIE	Nice to meet you.
JASON	How ya doin'?
DEBBIE	Good, how are you?
JASON	Just trying not to stare.
ALISON	She's married.
DEBBIE	Why do you have to say that?
ALISON	What?
JASON	It's a shame. You're beautiful.
DEBBIE	Thank you.
ALISON	She has two kids, too.
DEBBIE	Shut up!
ALISON	What? It's nothing to be ashamed of.
BEN	You think that's gonna stop him from hitting on her? It's not, at all.
JASON	I love kids.
DEBBIE	Really?
JASON	Yeah, absolutely.
DEBBIE	Excuse me. (into the phone) Hello?
BEN	Cool phone.
ALISON	Yeah, she's got a really cool phone.
DEBBIE	(into the phone) What? Is it a rash or is it the chicken pox? I don't know! Google it. Okay. All right, bye. (to Alison et al) I got to go. Sadie might have the chicken pox.
JASON	I had the chicken pox three times. I have no immunity to it.
BEN	We don't have the heart to tell him it's herpes.
JASON	It's not herpes if it's everywhere.
DEBBIE	Are you coming?
ALISON	Um, uh, you know, I'm all dressed, so I'll just hang out.
DEBBIE	Really?
ALISON	Yeah, I'll take a cab home.
DEBBIE	Be safe.
ALISON	I will.
JASON	Bye, lovely.
DEBBIE	Bye.
JASON	All right, I'm gonna let you two get to know each other.
BEN	Cheers.
ALISON	Cheers.
BEN	To you. Ben and Alison take pictures of each other with their cell
ALISON	No, no. You know, the like, Entertainment News channel?
BEN	Oh, E!
ALISON
JONAH	Dude, I think he's doing the dice thing too much.
JAY	That's really all he's got. Alison and Ben take another shot. Alison runs her fingers through
ALISON	I love your curly hair! It's so great. Do you, like, use product or anything? You put anything in it?
BEN	I use Jew. You want to get out of here?
ALISON	Yeah, let's go. We can go hang out at my place?
BEN	Yes, uh, uh, uh...
ALISON	I'll show you my audition tape.
BEN	Wicked.
ALISON	It's really funny.
BEN	Okay, I'm really excited to watch that.
BEN	We should get a cab.
BEN	This is a big yard!
ALISON	Shh!
BEN	Let's go swimming right now. Let's just do that.
ALISON	No.
BEN	I'm doin'-- Whoo!

PETE	You stop it.
ALISON	See ya later.
BEN	All righty.
PETE	See ya later. Enjoy the day. Never do what they did.
CHARLOTTE	I'm gonna do it.
PETE	You are? Uh-oh. Someone's getting home- schooled.
BEN	Whew. I just yacked, something nasty. I feel way better, though. I think that's the secret. You just gotta puke. Did you puke?

ALISON	How are you?
JAMES FRANCO	Great.
ALISON	Thanks for coming.
JAMES FRANCO	Of course.
ALISON	Tell me, were you a big fan...
ALISON	...I'm sorry, let me take that again.
JAMES FRANCO	Okay.
ALISON	Tell me, were you a big fan of the comic books growing up?
JAMES FRANCO	No, actually, I didn't read any of the comic books until I got the movie. JAMES FRANCO (cont'd) Are you okay?
ALISON	Uh-huh. Yeah, just, what about the comic books? Keep talking.
JAMES FRANCO	Like I said I really wasn't into them, but now that I did the research, I think they're pretty amazing. JAMES FRANCO (cont'd) What the fuck?
BRENT	Is that the sound of you puking?
BRENT	We should put this on YouTube.
ALISON	Shut up.
BRENT	This is hilarious.
ALISON	You're an asshole.
BRENT	Look how sweaty you are. You look like Dom DeLuise.
ALISON	I don't need to see it again. It's gonna make me throw up.
BRENT	You look like Jabba the Hutt dying.
ALISON	You're such an asshole.
BRENT	I'm just jerking your chain. I'll fix this. No problem.
ALISON	Yeah, maybe if you can just edit this out and we can re--
ALISON	--we can reshoot my questions.
BRENT	What's up? BRENT (CONT'D) (cont'd) Whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no, no. Over here. Not on the mixing board, not on the mixing board.
BRENT	Are you okay?
ALISON	Oh my god. Oh my god.
BRENT	Are you sick?
ALISON	I don't know.
BRENT	What'd you eat?
ALISON	I haven't eaten today yet.
BRENT	You haven't eaten yet?
ALISON	Do you have a napkin or something?
BRENT	Here, here. What do you have, like the flu?
ALISON	I don't know.
BRENT	God, I hope you're not pregnant.
ALISON	It's impossible. You have to have sex to get pregnant.
BRENT	(into the phone) B.K. It's Brent Master Five. Alison just puked. Dude, that's what I said. She's probably pregnant, right?
ALISON	Oh, shit.
BRENT	(into the phone) How does she look right now? She looks like she just realized that she's pregnant.
ALISON	No, I can't be pregnant. Right? That was what, eight weeks ago?
DEBBIE	Did you miss your period?
ALISON	No. Wait. I don't know. Shit. I don't know. I can't remember. I was, I mean, I've been really stressed at work. I can't remember my last period.
DEBBIE	Are you the lady who doesn't realize she's pregnant until she's sitting on the toilet and a kid pops out?
ALISON	Can you not joke right now? Don't joke right now. This is really serious.
DEBBIE	Did I meet him?
ALISON	Yeah. You know, he was kind of like medium height, sort of...chubby. Blonde, curly hair. Remember?
DEBBIE	With the man boobs.
ALISON	Yes! Here, I have this thing of him on my phone.
DEBBIE	Oh god. How did this happen?
ALISON	Oh, shit.
DEBBIE	Well there's only one way to find out.
DEBBIE	They're here! Here they are! Over here!
ALISON	Okay. "Positive Choice."
DEBBIE	"Easy, One, Two, Three."
ALISON	Here. Hurry up now. Come on.
ALISON	Get more! Get me a few more!
DEBBIE	Did you try the "Ova-Sure?"
ALISON	I'm dripping, I'm dripping. Wait.
DEBBIE	Good! A smiley face! Oh, I think that's bad.
ALISON	How long does this one take?
DEBBIE	These can't all be positive. Let me try one.
ALISON	God, you really had to pee.
DEBBIE	What is this? What the hell is this?
ALISON	I think you picked up the wrong one.
DEBBIE	Fuck. That scared me. That would suck.
DEBBIE	I'm sorry. That scared me.
ALISON	It's gonna be fine. Right? ALISON (CONT'D) (cont'd) Right?
DEBBIE	Of course it will be fine. It's gonna be fine.
ALISON	Shit.
DEBBIE	You just need to call him.
ALISON	Maybe I don't need to call him until after I see the doctor.
DEBBIE	You need to call.
ALISON	I don't want to call him. I don't need to call him.
DEBBIE	You should call.
ALISON	I can't call him anyway. He doesn't even have a phone. He didn't even have a number to give me.
DEBBIE	He doesn't have a phone?
ALISON	Said some kind of billing issue.
DEBBIE	He can't afford a phone? Sadie has a phone.
ALISON	Shit, you're right. I got to call. I don't know. I'm gonna have to look him up on his stupid website.
DEBBIE	What kind of website does he have?
DEBBIE	He spelling "coming" wrong. Oh it's "cum." That's gross.
ALISON	Just go to "Contact Us."
DEBBIE	Ben?
ALISON	Yeah.
DEBBIE	"What is your number? I need to speak with you right away." Send?
ALISON	Yep.
DEBBIE	You're sure?
ALISON	Yeah.
JAY	I love weed.
JONAH	I could smoke weed every second of every day.
BEN	(through the mask) Jay, I am your stoner.
JASON	Hey, Benjamin?
BEN	Yeah.
JASON	"Flesh of the Stars" just got an e- mail.
BEN	Really?
JASON	Would you like me to read it to you?
BEN	Yeah, sure.
JASON	"Ben, what is your number? I need to speak to you right away. Alison Scott"
BEN	Shit! Someone wants seconds, mama!
JASON	"Looking forward to speaking with you."
BEN	Yeah. Do one of those smiley faces at the end. Fuckin' A. Those are sexy.
JASON	Sent.
BEN	Uh-oh!
JAY	Somebody wants another piece!
BEN	Shhh....
JAY	Booty, booty, booty call.
BEN	(into the phone) Hello?
ALISON	(into the phone) Hi, Ben, this is Alison. I don't know if you remember me.
BEN	(into the phone) Oh, yeah, Alison. What's up?
JONAH	She like-a the way your dick tastes.
ALISON	(into the phone) I actually was just wondering if maybe you, wanted to get together, like tomorrow night?
BEN	(into the phone) I've been meaning to call you so we could hook up again. You know what I'm sayin'?
ALISON	(into the phone) Let's meet up maybe tomorrow night? You wanna just grab some dinner?
BEN	(into the phone) Why not? Meeting of minds sounds good. What do you say Geisha House, Hollywood, nine o'clock?
ALISON	(into the phone) Sure. That's cool. Can we make it more like six, though? I'd like to keep it early.
BEN	(into the phone) Six o'clock. Beat the rush. Yeah, leave more time for afterwards. Dessert. Sweet.
ALISON	(into the phone) Okay. I'll just meet you there, then, at six.
BEN	(into the phone) I'll see you there. Take care. Peace.
ALISON	Oh, shit.
BEN	I'm gonna get laid mother fuckers!
BEN	Nice place, huh?
ALISON	It's really nice.
BEN	Sorry it took so long to get a table. I didn't realize you needed a reservation.

ALISON	I am going to the doctor next week...and I thought you could come with me to the gynecologist.
BEN	So you haven't seen him, though?
ALISON	No.
BEN	So you don't know if you're pregnant.
ALISON	Well, I'm not a hundred percent sure.
BEN	You're not a hundred percent sure. I bet you're not pregnant.
ALISON	Yeah, yeah. Come on.
BEN	I'm supposed to go?
ALISON	Yes.
BEN	I'm Ben Stone.
ALISON	Alison.
ALISON	Good.
ALISON	I took a home pregnancy test and it said I was pregnant, so here we are.
BEN	Nice office. And you're next. I'm just kidding. DR. PELLAGRINO (CONT'D) (cont'd) There's the cervix. And the uterus. See that? That dark sac there, that's the amniotic sac. And right there, in the middle is the embryo. Do you see that flicker? You know what that is? That's the heartbeat. Yeah, it looks like you are pregnant. About eight or nine weeks, I'd say. Congratulations.
ALISON	That, that's it?
BEN	Oh, God. It's okay.
JONAH	I can't fuckin' believe you didn't wear a bag! Who does that?!
JASON	Why did we go to Costco and buy a year's supply of condoms if you weren't gonna use `em, man?
JONAH	I can't believe you did this. You fucked everything up.
JASON	Look, the real point is not to get yourself in this position. That's what you have to realize. You gotta know all the tricks. Like, for example, if a woman's on top, she can't get pregnant. It's just gravity.
JONAH	Everyone knows that.
JASON	What goes up must come down.
JAY	I think it's awesome that you're gonna have a kid, man. Think of it like this. It's just an excuse to play with all your old toys again.
JONAH	You know what I think you should do? Take care of it.
JAY	Tell me you don't want him to get an "A word."
JONAH	Yes, I do, and I won't say it for little Baby Ears over there, but it rhymes with shmish-mortion." I'm just saying -- hold on Jay, cover your ears -- you should get a "shmish-morshmion" are the "shmish-morshmion" clinic.
JAY	Ben, you cannot let these monsters have any part of your child's life. All right? I'm gonna be there to rear your child.
JASON	You hear that, Ben? Don't let him near the kid. He wants to rear your child!
JONAH	Aw, Ben. Ben, come on, man.
JASON	I'm just kidding you.
JAY	Oh, great. Now he's upset.
JASON	I won't let him do it.
BETTY	Alison, just take care of it. Take care of it. Move on. What's gonna happen with your career? Or how, how are you gonna tell them?
ALISON	Well, I'm not gonna tell them for a while. I have a while before I have to say anything.
BETTY	How could you not tell them?
ALISON	Well, they're not gonna know. I mean, I'm only gonna start to show when I'm like, I don't know, six months or something. Seven months.
BETTY	Three months.
ALISON	No.
BETTY	Three months. Fat in the face, jowls, fast ass.
ALISON	Debbie didn't get fat.
BETTY	Debbie is a freak of nature.
ALISON	Mom, you know, it's important to me that you be supportive.
BETTY	I cannot be supportive of this. This is a mistake. This is a big, big mistake. Now think about your stepsister. Now, you remember what happened with her? She had the same situation as you and she had it taken care of. And you know what? Now she has a real baby. Honey, this is not the time.
HARRIS	I'm gonna be a grandfather.
BEN	You happy about that?
HARRIS	Absolutely. Delighted.
BEN	This is a disaster.
HARRIS	No, this is not a disaster.
BEN	It is, you know?
HARRIS	An earthquake is a disaster. Your grandmother having Alzheimer's so bad she doesn't even know who the fuck I am, that's a disaster. This is a good thing. This is a blessing.
BEN	I had a vision for how my life would go and this definitely is not it.
HARRIS	Wait. Are you living your vision right now?
BEN	I am kinda living my vision, yeah.
HARRIS	Well, that is sad, I'm telling you. Life doesn't care about your vision. Okay?
BEN	Okay.
HARRIS	Stuff happens. You just got to deal with it. Roll with it. That's the beauty of it all.
BEN	I just don't get how I tell the kid not to do drugs when I do drugs. I'll feel like a hypocrite.
HARRIS	Well you remember what I told you? When you were a teenager?
BEN	What did you say?
HARRIS	I said, "No pill, no powders."
BEN	That's right, that's right.
HARRIS	Right. If it grows in the ground, it's probably okay.
BEN	I guess it worked. You told me not to smoke pot all those years. And then I found out you were smoking pot that whole time.
HARRIS	Not the whole time. Just in the evenings and all day every weekend. Not that much.
BEN	Honestly, though, when you look at me, do you not think at all, like, you know, if he just never existed, I would have avoided a massive heap of trouble? You know?
HARRIS	Absolutely not. I love you totally and completely. You're the best thing that ever happened to me.
BEN	I'm the best thing that ever happened to you?
HARRIS	Yeah.
BEN	Now I just feel bad for you.
BEN	Hello?
ALISON	Hi, Ben?
BEN	Hey Alison, how's it goin'?
ALISON	Good, good. You know, I was just calling to, let you know that, I've decided to keep the baby.That's what's happening with that.
BEN	Good. That's good. That's what I was hoping you'd do. So, awesome.
ALISON	Yeah, yeah, it is good.
BEN	I know we didn't plan this and neither of us really thought it was gonna happen but life is like that, you know? You can't plan for it and even if we did, life doesn't care about your plans, necessarily, and you just kinda have to go with the flow and I just know my job is to just support you in whatever it is you wanna do. I'm in, so whatever you wanna do, I'm gonna do.
BEN	I'm on board. Yaaay.
ALISON	I really appreciate you saying that.
BEN	No problem. I'll tell you, maybe if you could help me by telling me, like one thing that I am supposed to do, then that would be good, `cause I literally have no idea whatsoever.
ALISON	I have no idea either.
BEN	Do you want to, like, get together and talk about it or something like that?
ALISON	Yeah, sure.
BEN	Like a date? I mean...
ALISON	Yeah.
BEN
HEY
ALISON	Hi.
BEN	You look beautiful.
ALISON	Thank you.
BEN	No problem. Come on in.
BEN	Everyone, this is Alison.
ALISON	Hi.
JASON	Ally. Hey. Jason. I'm sure you remember.
ALISON	Yes.
JASON	You look beautiful.
ALISON	Thank you.
JASON	Your body's responding really well to the pregnancy.
ALISON	Thank you.
JASON	It's amazing how fast the milk arrives. How's your sis?
ALISON	She's good.
JASON	Oh, good. Tell her "What's up" for me.
ALISON	Okay.
JASON	All right, I'm gonna go make a protein shake.
BEN	And this, uh, beautiful young man is Jonah.
ALISON	Hi.
JONAH	Hey.
BEN	Okay, that's Martin and Jodi over there.
ALISON	Hi.
BEN	I'm gonna grab my shirt. Just take a seat if you want.
JONAH	Just another day at the office. Do you have any acting experience?
ALISON	No.
MARTIN	How's it goin'? You wanna toke?
ALISON	Eh, no. I'm good.
JODI	Hi.
ALISON	Hi.
JODI	I'm Jodi.
ALISON	Yeah, hi.
JODI	I heard you were pregnant.
ALISON	Mm-hm.
JODI	Oh, aren't you scared? The way it's gonna come out of your...It's gonna hurt a lot I bet. Your vagina...That's so sick.
ALISON	I don't know.
JODI	Are you hungry?
ALISON	I'm okay right now. Thank you.
JODI	You must be angry at the baby whenever it steals your food, huh? "Oh it's mine, not yours." But, you know... Because you're family, you got to share.
ALISON	Right.
JAY	Man, my balls are shaved. My pubes are trimmed. I'm ready to fuckin' rock this shit.
JONAH	What the fuck, man?! If I go in there and see fuckin' pubes sprinkled on the toiled seat, I'm gonna fuckin' lose my mind! Last time I went to the bathroom, Jay, I took a shit and my shit looked like a fuckin' stuffed animal!
JAY	You're embarrassing me in company!
JONAH	You embarrass yourself!
JAY	Oh, great. I hope you have a great evening!
BEN	All right. Let's go. See you guys later.
ALISON	The funny thing is I really had never even thought about having a baby.
BEN	Yeah.
ALISON	If this hadn't happened, I don't think I would have wanted to have a baby for, like, I don't know, at least ten years.
BEN	At least! God, honestly, I just got used to the notion that someone would even have sex with me. I didn't think this would happen.
BEN	Get ready. This will be coming out of you in seven months. This is exactly what our baby will look like.
ALISON	It's a beautiful picture, Ben.
BEN	It is. It's not bad. (in a French accent) Hello, Mommy. Our baby's gonna be French Canadian. I like that.
ALISON	With a little hint of Spanish.
BEN	Exactly, I'm not good with accents.
BEN	Baby books.
ALISON	Awesome.
BEN	"What to Expect When You're Expecting."
ALISON	What can we expect?
BEN	Well, you can't eat sushi. You can't smoke. You can't smoke marijuana. You can't smoke crack. And you can't jump on trampolines. This is basically a giant list of things you can't do.
ALISON	It sounds thrilling.
BEN	I'm gonna be sitting there on the trampoline smoking crack. And you're not gonna have anything to do. You're gonna be bored. But I can't wait to read these, honestly. I put these in front of my toilet, though, they'll be read by tomorrow morning. Do you want me to get you that?
ALISON	Yeah, thank you.
BEN	No problem. These are heavy.
PETE	So what do you think? Should we have sex tonight?
DEBBIE	Ugh. Sounds awful. I'm just really constipated. Do you really want to?
PETE	Well, now.
DEBBIE	Shut up.
PETE	That's pretty crazy how your sister's pregnant.
DEBBIE	We have to help her.
PETE	I think they'll be fine. They'll work it...Look at us. It happened to us.
DEBBIE	We'll help her raise the baby.
PETE	Well...fuck!
BEN	At least we don't have to use a condom, you know? BEN (CONT'D) (cont'd) But we can. I brought some just in case. I don't have V.D. or anything. I mean, I don't, I thought--
ALISON	It's not that.
BEN	It's just I thought we could get a little...fun out of your situation, you know?
ALISON	Okay, first of all, it's not my situation. It's our situation.
BEN	I know that.
ALISON	And just because I'm pregnant, I'm not some ruined woman and all romance goes out the door.
BEN	I'm sorry. I like you a lot. That's all this is.
ALISON	I like you, too.
BEN	Sweet.
ALISON	A little, so far. I mean, we have seven months before the baby comes. We don't have to rush it.
BEN	Yeah.
ALISON	We should really just try to get to know each other and...give this a real shot. You know? We got ourselves into this situation. We kind of have to.
BEN	For the baby, right?
ALISON	Exactly. Okay, if this was our second date, what would you do?
BEN	B.J. If I'm just being honest. I told my roommates that I thought I was gonna get a B.J., so...
ALISON	You know what? For the sake of getting to know one another, can you not talk like that?
BEN	I can do that. I'm really nervous.
ALISON	I'm nervous, too. I'm really nervous.
BEN	Yeah.
ALISON	You're a sweet guy, right?
BEN	I think I am.
ALISON	Don't fuck me over, okay?
BEN	I wouldn't do that. Just so you know, I'm the guy girls fuck over. I'm that guy. So you don't fuck me over, okay?
ALISON	Okay.
BEN	I couldn't take it. I can't raise this baby alone.
CHARLOTTE	Who's he?
BEN	I'm Ben Stone.
ALISON	He's my boyfriend.
PETE	That's nice.
SADIE	I never met him before.
ALISON	He's a new boyfriend.
BEN	But a boyfriend.
SADIE	So he came over for breakfast because he's your new boyfriend?
DEBBIE	He came from his house, drove over to our house because he thought it would be fun to have breakfast with us, so he drove his car from his house to our house to have breakfast.
PETE	Because he likes breakfast so much.
CHARLOTTE	I love breakfast.
BEN	You guys wanna hear something neat? We're gonna have a baby together.
SADIE	What?
BEN	Yeah, a baby.
SADIE	Well, you're not married. Aren't you supposed to be married to have a baby?
PETE	You don't have to be.
DEBBIE	But they should be because they love each other and people who love each other get married and have babies.
SADIE	Where do babies come from?
DEBBIE	Where do you think they come from?
SADIE	Well, I think a stork, he drops it down, and then, a hole goes in your body and there's blood everywhere, coming out of your head, and then you push your belly-button, and then your butt falls off and then you hold you butt and you have to dig and you find a little baby.
DEBBIE	That's exactly right.
CHARLOTTE	Feed the teddy bear.
BEN	I feed your bear the grass? Know what your bear would also like to do with some grass? Smoke it.
ALISON	What do you think of him? He's funny, right?
BEN	Fetch. All right, bring it back.
DEBBIE	He's playing fetch with my kids. He's treating my kids like they're dogs.
ALISON	No's he not.
BEN	Go get it! Fetch!
DEBBIE	Plays fetch with the kids.
BEN	All right!
ALISON	He's trying. He's making an effort.
CHARLOTTE	I don't wanna play this anymore.
BEN	Bring it back.
DEBBIE	He's overweight. Where does that end? How old is he?
ALISON	Twenty-three.
DEBBIE	Looks thirty-three. He can barely get in and out of that little house. Imagine how much bigger he's going to get.
DEBBIE	That means he has bad genes. Your kid is going to be overweight.
ALISON	Shit.
BEN	I'm gonna get you!
BEN	I'm gonna get you! Whoa!
ALISON	Just give him a break.
DEBBIE	Okay, I'll try.
BEN	They seem to love bubbles.
PETE	They go ape-shit over bubbles.
BEN	They're really going ape-shit.
PETE	That's an incredible thing about a child. What's so great about bubbles?
BEN	They float. You can pop them. I mean, I get it. I get it.
PETE	I wish I liked anything as much as my kids like bubbles.
BEN	That's sad.
PETE	It's totally sad. Their smiling faces just point out your inability to enjoy anything.
BEN	Am I going to be okay, man?
PETE	Who knows? Is anybody okay? I'm not okay. You're asking the wrong guy. Just don't ask me to lend you any money, you know?
BEN	Can I just have some?
PETE	No.
JASON	I have fifteen years of tennis lessons.
JONAH

JASON	I thought you went to Santa Monica City College.
JONAH	I went where I went, Jason.
BEN	I'm not asking you to work twelve hours a day. I mean, you guys watch movies without nudity in them.
JASON	I'll tell you what, man. We could probably get it online in three months.
BEN	Thank you. Yes! Three months.
JONAH	Come on, Jason!
JONAH	Fuck off!
JASON	Yeah, well, you still have a little dick, Cartman.
ALISON	No.
ALISON	I have on occasion.
ALISON	How ya doing?
BEN	I'm breathing like James Gandolfini over here.
BEN	(to nearby athlete) Slow down, man. You're making me look like a jackass.
YOUNG DOCTOR	How long you kids been married?
BEN	We're not.
ALISON	No.
YOUNG DOCTOR	You're single?
BEN	She's not single. She's just not married.
YOUNG DOCTOR	Are you two together?
JODI	Hey, you wanna trade boyfriends? Just kidding. Kind of.
FEMALE DOCTOR	Wow. That is not your vagina. That's your asshole. That happens about five times a day.
JAY	Are you sure you don't want to come paint-balling?
BEN	Have fun, guys. Seriously, watch the eyes.
JAY	All right.
JASON	See ya, Ally.
JONAH	Peace.
JAY	Bye.
BEN	I don't want to go. I swear to God. I want to see "Breathless" at the LACMA.
ALISON	Boobs! Boobs! Boobs!
BEN	Hold on, pause it, pause it, pause it.
ALISON	Boobs and bush.
ALISON	Good boobs.
BEN	Those are good ones! We're like thirty- five seconds in.
ALISON	Right over the beginning credits.
BEN	Nice. Credit bush. You never get opening-credit bush.
ALISON	I know. That's so crazy.
BEN	You got me. You got me.
ALISON	How many doctors are there in your practice? Just because I'm sort of looking for a more personal experience. I want to make sure that you're my doctor on the day and...
ALISON	I feel really good about this. I think we found our doctor.
BEN	Really?
ALISON	Yeah.
BEN	Oh, my God. Are you serious right now?
BEN	I am very relieved.
BEN	I can't imagine meeting and more of you people.
ALISON	You're being dramatic. We didn't meet that many.
WARDROBE LADY	Ooh. Do they know?
ALISON	Pardon?
WARDROBE LADY	The belly.
ALISON	The doughnuts, they call to me.
WARDROBE LADY
YOU'RE--
JILL	Hey, Alison!
ALISON	Hi.
JILL	Great job.
ALISON	Thanks.
JILL	For you.
WARDROBE LADY	You're pregnant aren't you?
ALISON	What?
WARDROBE LADY	I mean, you've put on like eight pounds, nine. It's all in your uterus.
ALISON	Oh, shit. I haven't told them. Do you think they're gonna be mad? I'm really chickening out about this.
WARDROBE LADY	It's okay. We can hide this. We'll dress you in black and we'll emphasize your boobs.
ALISON	Awesome.
WARDROBE LADY	Your boobs are going to be big. And then they're going to be like scary big. But then they'll go down. And then they'll stay down.
ALISON	Just don't say anything, okay? Please don't say anything.
WARDROBE LADY	I won't. Just tell them. They'll be cool. Everybody loves somebody pregnant.
DEBBIE	Ooh. Did you see this sex offender website? These are all the sex offenders in our neighborhood.
PETE	Looks like your computer has chicken pox.
DEBBIE	Those are sex offenders. These people live in our neighborhood.
PETE	We'll skip their houses when we're trick or treating. What do you want me to do? Form a posse? Got your six-shooter on ya? I got my lynching rope.
DEBBIE	You shouldn't take it so lightly.
PETE	I don't take it lightly. I'm not going to go over to any of these people's houses and say, "Hey, you mind? Can you baby sit?"
DEBBIE	If I didn't care about these things, you wouldn't care about anything. Care more.
PETE	You're so concerned with stuff, like don't get them vaccinated, don't let them eat fish. There's mercury in the water. Jesus, how much "Dateline NBC" can you watch?
DEBBIE	I know we're supposed to be nice with each other right now, but I'm having a really hard time. I'm struggling with it right now.
PETE	What am I doing?
DEBBIE	Because I want to rip your fucking head off because you're so fucking stupid! This is scary.
DEBBIE	These are our children. You fucking dipshit!
PETE	I literally am at a point where I don't know what I can say.
DEBBIE	So I'm the bad guy because I'm trying to protect our kids from child molesters and mercury? And you're cool because you don't give a shit?
PETE	Yeah.
DEBBIE	Yeah? Is that it?
PETE	Pretty much.
DEBBIE	God, you're an asshole.
PETE	Don't do this in front of Ben.
DEBBIE	I don't give a shit about Ben.
PETE	Sorry, Ben.
BEN	It's okay. I didn't think she did, anyway.
ALISON	Okay, come on! Let's go.
PETE	I can't go. This band is doing a showcase out in the Valley. I got to go.
DEBBIE	It's Saturday.
PETE	I got to go.
DEBBIE	You don't want to know the sex of the baby? That's no fun.
ALISON	Ben knows, but I've sworn him to secrecy.
DEBBIE	I'll get it out of him.
BEN	Hey. Think we'll ever be as happy as Baby Bjorn couple is?
ALISON	We are that happy.
BEN	Yeah. You look happy.
ALISON	Which is awesome. Because I never like guys like you. It's great.
BEN	You keep saying that. I know.
DEBBIE	This is it. This is perfect.
BEN	Nice.
BEN	Holy shit, it's fourteen hundred bucks.
ALISON	We can just borrow yours. Is that okay?
DEBBIE	No. You need your own crib.
BEN	There's one of these in an alley behind my house. We could just grab that. Just rub Purell all over it.
DEBBIE	You know what? Let me buy it. I need to get you a baby present anyway, and I would love to get it for you.
ALISON	No.
DEBBIE	I'm serious. I want to.
ALISON	No. It's too much.
BEN	(whispering to Alison) Shh. Yes. We'll take it obviously. I mean don't insult the woman. She wants to get us a gift.
DEBBIE	Right.
BEN	Want to buy me some new clothes? What else can I squeeze out of you?
ALISON	It's so hot in the Valley.
GIRL #1	Hey!
GIRL #2	Oh, my God!
ALISON	Oh, shit.
GIRL #1	Alison!
ALISON
GIRL #2
ALISON
GIRL #2
ALISON
GIRL #2
ALISON
BEN
GIRL #2
GIRL #1
BEN
GIRL #2
ALISON
BEN
ALISON
GIRL #1
ALISON
BEN
ALISON	All right.
BEN	You know they say don't drink and drive?
GUY #1	Right.
BEN	Don't drink and bone!
GIRL #2	Wow.
BEN	Yeah, she was acting weird and I really think it's just because I haven't made an honest woman out of her. She's carrying my bastard child. No one wants that.
PETE	That's what I did. I married Debbie when she got pregnant.
BEN	You think she's, like, hiding me? Like, she's, like, embarrassed by me or something like that?
PETE	Probably. I'd hide you.
BEN	How much do wedding rings cost?
PETE	It really depends, you know? I think you're supposed to spend three months pay on a ring.
BEN	That'll be easy. I don't make any money.
PETE	Really? I thought there was a lot of money in porn.
BEN	God, it's not porn? All we do is we show you what nude scenes are in what movies.
PETE	Like Mister Skin?
BEN	Who's Mister Skin?
PETE	Dude, Mister Skin.
JONAH	We've wasted fourteen months of our lives.
BEN	This is exactly the same as our site. How the fuck did this happen?
JONAH	Mister Skin! That's even a better name than ours!
MARTIN	Well, fuck me in the beard.
JASON	Dude, they got the top ten group shower scenes! Why didn't you think of that, Jay!
JAY	Don't put this on me!
BEN	God damn it!
MARTIN	Well shit. I saw it online at one point, but I guess I didn't connect the dots.
JONAH	What are we gonna do now?
BEN	All we need to do is think of a new, better idea that no one else has thought of already.
JASON	"Spiderman Three" starts in eight minutes.
JONAH	Shit. Don't worry. We'll figure it out.
BEN	You know what? Just because this site exists doesn't mean ours won't work. Good things come in pairs.
JAY	For sure.
BEN	"Volcano," "Dante's Peak." "Deep Impact," "Armageddon." "Wyatt Earp," "Tombstone."
JAY	Panda Express, Yoshinoya Beef Bowl.
BEN	Exactly. We can work together. This helps us, if anything.
JAY	We're golden.
BEN	Alison, I'm sure this isn't how you pictured it being exactly and it's not how I wanted it. That is why I'm presenting you with this empty box. It's a promise, Alison. A promise that one day I will fill this with a ring that you deserve, a beautiful ring. I can't afford it yet. I've picked it out, though. It's at De Beers and it's really nice. So, basically, I'm asking you, will you marry me? Because I'm in love with you.
ALISON	I love you too.
BEN	Really? That's so nice to hear. That's the first time a girl's ever said that to me.
ALISON	But here's the thing.
BEN	There's a thing?
ALISON	I don't really know yet what that love means. It's so new and it's so exciting. It's great. I don't know. We've only known each other for seventeen weeks.
BEN	Look, I thought you felt weird that we're having a baby and we're not engaged. I'm going to get off my knee. It hurts.
ALISON	I'm okay with that. We're just doing what we can. I don't want us to put any more pressure on ourselves than we have.
BEN	That makes sense.
ALISON	I didn't hurt your feelings, did I?
BEN	No. I just wanted to do right by you. If you don't want to, that's totally cool.
ALISON	I really do love you.
BEN	I know. Thanks. You mentioned that. It's nice.
ALISON	Ben proposed to me. He did. It was really sweet. I feel a little bad. He was wearing this great button-down. He tucked it in. He got down on one knee. He didn't have an actual ring, though, just an empty box but he had this whole spiel about when he has the money, he'll buy me the ring I deserve.
DEBBIE	The box was empty?
ALISON	He can't afford a ring.
DEBBIE	So he got down on one knee and gave you an empty box?
ALISON	Yes.
DEBBIE	I'm sorry.
ALISON	Get over it. If you'd been there, you would have cried.
DEBBIE	You need to train him. Oprah said that when two people meet they should point out each other's differences and flaws.
ALISON	I thought you should love people for who they are.
DEBBIE	You criticize them a lot, so they get so down on themselves they have to change.
ALISON	You don't think that's naggy?
DEBBIE	In the end, they thank you for it.
DEBBIE	You can't commit to him. You don't even know him. I don't even know Pete after ten years. I don't know what he's up to. He's miserable.
ALISON	Why do you say that?
DEBBIE	I think he's cheating on me. He's always going to business meetings at odd hours. Then I try to call him on his cell phone and he says he's in bad cell phone reception areas when he's in good reception areas.
ALISON	Maybe he's working late. Maybe he's trying to sign a new band. I can't imagine Pete doing that.
DEBBIE	There's no part of you that thinks maybe he's a dirty little scumbag?
ALISON	No.
DEBBIE	I think he might be.
DEBBIE	"Memory Spy Web Memory Software. Locate history, files, websites visited, hidden downloads, e-mail history. Memory Spy." Let's see you hide from me now, little man.
PETE	You're not going to tell them?
ALISON	No. I don't have to. It's illegal for them to fire me over it. And I get three months maternity leave if I stay. So I'm not going to tell them.
DEBBIE	Good plan.
PETE	I like it.
BEN	It's a good plan until her water breaks over Robert De Niro's shoes. (impersonating Robert De
NIRO)	My shoes. There's baby goo on them.
PETE	(impersonating Robert De
NIRO)	These shoes? On these shoes? Did you puke on my shoes?
BEN	(impersonating Robert De
NIRO)	Is your water on my shoes?
PETE	(back as Pete) Isn't it weird, though, when you have a kid and all your dreams and hopes go right out the window.
DEBBIE	What changed for you? What went out the window? You do everything exactly the same.
PETE	No, I love what I'm doing. But say before you're married with children you want to live in India for a year. You can do it.
DEBBIE	You want to go to India? Go to India! Seriously.
PETE	Do you want to go to India?
DEBBIE	No. You can go.
BEN	I get what he means. Honestly, when I found out about...
BEN	...I had this flash of me in a white Ford Bronco hauling ass for Canada. The chopper's taping it, and I bust through the border and I'm free! I kept thinking that.
BEN	It was a flash!
ALISON	What do you mean?
BEN	Don't look at me. We can talk about our fears here. If Doc Brown screeched up to you in the DeLorean and said, "Alison, I got the car here. What do you want to do?" No part of you would think, "Maybe I'll go back to that night and put a condom on Ben's dick?" You never got that flash?
ALISON	No. What are you talking about?
PETE	"Where we're going, we don't need roads."
BEN	You wouldn't do that?
ALISON	I don't know who Doc Brown is. What are you talking about?
BEN	Doc Brown is Christopher Lloyd. He invented the DeLorean time machine.
PETE	Everyone has a time machine image.
DEBBIE	I have a really good idea. Why don't you two get in your time machine, go back in time and fuck each other?
PETE	Who needs a time machine?
BEN	This is my time machine!
PETE	I'll throw you in my DeLorean and gun it to 88.
BEN	You are a funny motherfucker, man. How can you fight with him? I just want to kiss his face. He's cute.
PETE	I like the way you move.
BEN	This is fun! We should do this more. This is the most fun I've had in a really long time.
ALISON	Come on, harder.
BEN	I can't.
ALISON	Why? Just do it deeper.
BEN	I can't.
ALISON	Why?
BEN	I'll poke the baby if I go deeper.
ALISON	Just do it!
BEN	Please don't yell at me.
ALISON	The doctor and Debbie said it's fine. Come on!
BEN	I'm sorry, can we change positions? I'm going to crush the baby.
ALISON	That's ridiculous!
BEN	No, it's not. It has no shell.
ALISON	Millions of people have sex when they're pregnant! It just works!
BEN	I weigh over 200 pounds.
ALISON	Just get over it.
BEN	I can't do it. Can you just get on top? All I can see if our baby, poked in the face by my penis.
ALISON	Trust me, you're not even close. Okay, fine.
ALISON	I can't do this. I can't focus like this. I look disgusting from this angle. I can feel you looking at my chins.
BEN	You look beautiful. Your chin looks so skinny.
ALISON	And my boobs are all like, squishy and they're flopping around. I can feel it and it's distracting. It's all National Geographic.
BEN	Do you want to do it doggie style?
ALISON	No. I do not want you to fuck me like a dog.
BEN	I'm not fucking you like a dog. It's doggie style. It's just the style. I'm, it's not like a dog. We don't have to go outside or anything.
BEN	Here we go. Is it good?
ALISON	Yeah.
BEN	Should I go slower?
ALISON	Harder.
BEN	Just tell me when you're close.
ALISON	Just go harder.
BEN	Okay.
ALISON	Keep going!
BEN	Oh, God. Oh, fuck!
ALISON	What happened?
BEN	The baby. It kicked my hand.
ALISON	It always kicks.
BEN	No, no, no, no, no.
ALISON	It's fine.
BEN	Not like this. No, this was a warning kick.
ALISON	Just keep going.
BEN	This was a bad kick.
ALISON	It's fine! It's fine!
BEN	Look. My dick must be like an inch away from its face and it's coming, just coming in at its face. What if it kicked because it didn't like it? I can't do that to our baby. That's the first thing it's going to see.
ALISON	What are you talking about?
BEN	It's having the baby between us, it just makes it weird. I'm sorry. It just freaks me out a bit. It's a little weird.
ALISON	I have totally lost it now.
BEN	You've totally lost it?
ALISON	I've lost it.
BEN	Okay.
ALISON	Great, you know what? Just forget it.
ALISON	(holding back tears) Don't worry. I won't make you do this again.
BEN	Shit.
ALISON	Ben?
BEN	Fuck me.
JAY	Oh my God! It's the Russians.
MARTIN	Jodi! I'll protect you!
ALISON	Ben!
BEN	Oh, my God! Oh, no! Oh, no!
JAY	That was horrible! That was so horrible.
JASON	You're fine, man.
JAY	When will it be light out?
JASON	Take it easy.
JAY	When will it be light out?
JASON	Did anybody turn off the gas?
MARTIN	I didn't do it.
JASON	Oh, motherfucker.
JONAH	Martin, this is my friend, Alex. She's a pretty incredible person.
MARTIN	Nice to meet you.
JONAH	Whoa, whoa, whoa. Dude! Not cool, Martin.
MARTIN	That's, that wasn't...
JONAH	Hey, are you serious, Howard Hughes?
JODI	What happened?
MARTIN	Nothing. Nothing happened. Come on.
ALISON	Where were you?
BEN	Look, I forgot you were sleeping over. I'm sorry okay?
ALISON	Yeah, because you were getting high off your huge bong. How am I supposed to be comfortable with the idea that you can take care of me and the baby if you are always getting high?
BEN	You want me to stop smoking pot because there's an earthquake once every ten years? That makes no sense, Alison. You're being irrational. Just relax. We're all scared. Oh, shit, the cops.
BEN	California. Hey!
BEN	You know it's times like this I'm glad I don't own nice things. It's a big mess, but there's only like fifty bucks worth of shit here. That's kind of the good thing. You know, my dad told me, "Don't move to Northridge." But you figure, what are the chances of that happening twice, you know?
ALISON	What is this?
BEN	It's a ninja weapon. I hope this place doesn't get condemned. That would suck.
BEN	Hello?
ALISON	Hey it's me.
BEN	You!
ALISON	Hi! So, listen. Will you do me a big favor? Debbie wants us to come over and have dinner tonight. She thinks Pete is cheating on her.
BEN	Really?
ALISON	Yeah. Well, she saw one of his e-mails and there's an address. Ugh.
BEN	Oh, man. I don't want to do that.
ALISON	Ben, come on.
BEN	He's not cheating on her.
ALISON	How do you know?
BEN	I just know.
ALISON	Are you sure?
BEN	I'm one hundred percent sure he's not cheating.
ALISON	Are you really?
BEN	No. It actually kind of makes sense that he would cheat.
ALISON	Why?
BEN	Because Debbie's a pain in the ass and Pete's awesome?
ALISON	Well, why don't you just come over then, and, we'll just diffuse the situation a little?
PETE	I'm just saying the music industry is different now. Steely Dan would never even have a chance.
BEN	Well, maybe it's because Steely Dan gargles my balls.
PETE	They're incredible.
BEN	They really aren't good, man.
PETE	Old Steely Dan.
BEN	If I ever listen to Steely Dan, I want you to slice my head off with an Al Jarreau LP.
PETE	I should get going. I'm supposed to see this band tonight in Hollywood. Actually, they're playing in Laurel Canyon, so I'll call you because the reception's terrible over there.
BEN	That's true.
PETE	And I don't want you to worry. I'm just going to jump in the shower. It would be terrible if I smelled worse than the band.
DEBBIE	Okay. Have fun.
BEN	You guys are crazy. He's acting totally normal and hilarious.
BEN	She doesn't have a gun, does she?
ALISON	No. I don't think so.
BEN	Oh, great.
BEN	Looks like no one's home.
DEBBIE	Why was the door unlocked? Wait here.
BEN	I just feel bad for Pete.
ALISON	What?
BEN	I feel like this isn't a good way to get caught cheating, it shouldn't be like this.
ALISON	Well, maybe he should have thought of that before he was cheating.
BEN	(through a fake cough) Pete!
ALISON	Stop it.
BEN	I coughed. What do you want from me?
DEBBIE	There's nobody up there.
BEN	Thank you.
DEBBIE	I guess I was wrong.
BEN	I told you. Can we get out of here, please?
ALISON	Yeah, come on. Let's go.
DEBBIE	Did you hear that?
ALISON	What?
BEN	I didn't hear anything.
ALISON	Come on.
PETE	Carlos Delgado.
PETE	Oh shit!
PETE	Hideki Matsui.
PETE	Sorry, Charlie.
DEBBIE	What is this?
PETE	Debbie.
DEBBIE	What the fuck is this?
PETE	It's our fantasy baseball draft.
DEBBIE	Your fantasy what?
PETE	It's, it's our draft...for fantasy baseball. I told you all about this. Got Matsui.
PETE	Aw, shit.

DEBBIE	Well, what did you do last Wednesday night when you said you went to see a band?
PETE	I went to the movies.
DEBBIE	With who?
PETE	By myself.
DEBBIE	What'd you see?
PETE	"Spiderman Three."
DEBBIE	Why do you want to go by yourself? Why didn't you ask me to go?
PETE	Because I needed to get away, you know? With work and you and the kids, sometimes I just need some time to myself.
DEBBIE	I need time for myself. I want time for myself, too.
DEBBIE	You're not the only one.
PETE	It's not that big of a deal.
DEBBIE	I like Spiderman.
PETE	Okay, so let's see "Spiderman Three" next week.
DEBBIE	I don't want to go see it now.
PETE	Well...
DEBBIE	I don't want to have to ask you to ask me. I want you to just come up with it on your own.
PETE	What? I don't even know what to say. Uh, what do you want me to do?
DEBBIE	You just think because you don't yell that you're not mean, but this is mean.
PETE	I'm not being mean. I'm being honest. You're telling me I need to be honest.
JUST--
DEBBIE	No, you're not. You're lying.
PETE	I'm doing it because I need to keep my sanity a little bit.
DEBBIE	You know what? I don't want you at the house anymore. Okay?
PETE	Come on.
BEN	Oh, shit, she's coming back.
BEN	How come we go to the gynecologist so often? I bet we have to go so much so we can pay for that three-hundred- thousand-dollar machine he has.
ALISON	I cannot stop thinking about what an asshole Pete is.
BEN	That's a little strong, I would say.
ALISON	Really? Because that had to be one of the most selfish things I've ever witnessed.
BEN	It's understandable. I even think it's kind of funny.
ALISON	What's funny about it?
BEN	Well, you won't laugh now, I wouldn't imagine, but you know, the situation.

ALISON	I've had to sacrifice my job, my body, my youth, my vagina!
BEN	You've sacrificed your vagina?
ALISON	Yes! It will never look the same after this!
BEN	Well. Fine. I'll pay for vaginal reconstructive surgery.
ALISON	You can't pay for shit! You can barely buy spaghetti.
BEN	You're right. Fine!
ALISON	You know what? Get out of the car.
BEN	Oh! You know what? Why don't you not threaten me?!
ALISON	You should just get out of the fucking car.
BEN	I'm not going to get out of the car in the middle of nowhere! No!
ALISON	Get out of the car.
BEN	No!
ALISON	I own this car! Get out of my car!
BEN	No.
ALISON	Get out of my car!
BEN	No.
ALISON	Get out of my fucking car!
BEN	Can you let me back in the car, please? Have you calmed down? Did you take a breath? I have no clue where we are!
BEN	Fine. Go. Great.
ALISON	You know what? Maybe I should take my shoes off. Or my belt buckle. My belt buckle's huge.
ALISON	Are you fucking kidding me?
BEN	Why don't you take off your earrings, too? They weigh about eighty pounds. They're made out of moon rocks aren't they?
ALISON	Do not make fun of me. Okay? I am hormonal, I am terrified, and I am falling apart, so stop treating everything like it's a big joke!
BEN	I'm sorry you're freaking out, but I just walked three fucking miles through Koreatown to get here. Sorry if I'm trying to lighten the mood a little.
ALISON	Well, don't! Okay?! You can't take anything seriously! You didn't even read the baby books.
BEN	I didn't read the baby books! What's gonna happen? How did anyone ever give birth without a baby book?!
BEN	That's right, the ancient Egyptians fucking engraved "What to Expect When You're Expecting" on the pyramid walls! I forgot about that! Who gives a flying fuck about the baby books?!
ALISON	It just shows your lack of commitment, Ben! That you're not in this with me!
BEN	Did you just say my lack of commitment? Because that's what it sounded like. It almost seems as though you forgot I proposed to you like an asshole! And you said no to me!
ALISON	If you feel that way, you should just go. Really. Just go. Because we didn't mean to do this together, okay? And, and we tried to make it work and that was good, I suppose.
ALISON	But it doesn't work. Because we are two completely different people. And I think it would just be easier for both of us if we stop fooling ourselves.
BEN	You know what? I know this isn't you talking, it's your hormones, but I would just like to say, "Fuck you, hormones! You are a crazy bitch, hormones! Not Alison! Hormones!" Fuck them. It's a girl. Buy some pink shit!
ALISON	Nice. You are such an asshole. You know what? Go fuck your fucking bong, you fuck!
BEN	I will fuck my bong. Doggie-style, for once.
ALISON	I'm really sorry about all that. That was really inappropriate.
ALISON	I don't feel so stupid, then.
BEN	I totally know what you're talking about, man. If I wrote out the list of shit Alison doesn't let me do it would be endless. Don't smoke pot. Don't have samurai swords in your room. Don't have illegal grow operations in the house. I could go on all fucking day. Have I told her to stop doing anything ever? No.
PETE	Marriage is like that show "Everybody Loves Raymond," but it's not funny. All the problems are the same, but it's... Instead of all the funny, pithy dialogue, everybody's just really pissed off and tense. Marriage is like an unfunny, tense version of "Everybody Loves Raymond," but it doesn't last twenty-two minutes. It lasts forever.
BEN	Let's get out of here, man. Honestly, let's just go. Let's go to Vegas.
PETE	Let's do it.
BEN	Yeah.
PETE	Why not?
DEBBIE	Get up.
ALISON	What?
DEBBIE	We're not going to do this. Seriously.
ALISON	What are you doing?
DEBBIE	We have to do something! And have fun!
ALISON	I'm just so tired.
DEBBIE	I know you're tired. But we're going to be untired! We're going to go live!
ALISON	Ugh. I hate you so much sometimes.
DEBBIE	We're going to be positive.
ALISON	How many Red Bulls have you had?
DEBBIE	I've had about three Red Bulls in the last fifteen minutes. And I feel fabulous! We're going to create a new life and it's going to be awesome! Let's go!
BEN	Since when do we lock this fucking thing? Come on!
JASON	Yo. We can't go, dude. Sorry.
BEN	Holy crap! What happened?
JONAH	We got pink eye.
BEN	What? You giving each other butterfly kisses or something?
JASON	Very funny. That's not how you get pink eye. You get it from poo particles making their way into your ocular cavities.
JAY	Hey, Ben.
BEN	Yo.
JAY	How's it going? I farted on Jason's pillow as a practical joke. He farted on Jonah's, thinking it was mine. And then eventually pink-eyes my pillow. I'm not proud of this. But, I think we've all forgiven each other. But, we can't go anywhere.
PETE	You can get pink eye from farting in a pillow?
JONAH	Totally.
PETE	That's awesome.
JONAH	Yeah, but you got to be bare-assed.
BEN	Jesus. Martin got it bad! What, did someone take a dump right in your eye?
MARTIN	No. No pink eye for me. I'm just really...high.
BEN	Well stay back, guys. I got to get my suit.
JASON	Are you Debbie's husband?
PETE	Yeah.
BEN	This is fun!
PETE	This is great. We're going to have the best time ever.
BEN	We make a good team, man.
PETE	Yep. It's like I can't come here with Debbie. She doesn't understand. It's like she wants to hold me in, and she was telling Alison she could train you.
BEN	She thinks she could train me?
PETE	Yeah, like you're running the Triple Crown.
BEN	She can't train this! I'm like Siegfried and Roy's Bengal. You think I'm trained. I'll bite your fucking face off.
PETE	That's right.
BEN	In front of a crowd, baby.
PETE	This is better. Besides I don't know if I have enough of these babies to go around.
BEN	Oh, my God. Are these mushrooms?
PETE	I got them from a roadie for the Black Crowes.
BEN	I'm eating them.
PETE	Oh, no, save it! I got tickets to Cirque du Soleil.
BEN	You do?! No you don't.
PETE	I swear to God, man.
BEN	Holy shit!
PETE	I see the beam of light.
BEN	There it is, baby.
PETE	Woo-hoo. You're so money that you don't even know how much money you have.
BEN	I love Vegas, man.
PETE	This is the greatest place on earth.
BEN	It's really amazing here.
PETE	Whoa. You got my tie. This is awesome.
BEN	Now that's how you get pink eye.
DOORMAN	(to the Two Pretty Girls) Hey, what's up, baby girl?
DEBBIE	Hi.
DOORMAN	What's up? End of the line, please.
DEBBIE	Really?
DOORMAN	Yeah.
DEBBIE	Oh, come on.
DOORMAN	Look, we're at capacity, okay? We'll let some people in when it clears out a little. You'll get right in if you go back to the end of the line.
DEBBIE	We come here all the time. It's not a big deal. It doesn't really look that crowded in there.
DOORMAN	Hey, look, I don't make the rules.
DEBBIE	Please?
DOORMAN	No.
DOORMAN	Hey, what's up, shorty? What's up pretty girls? See y'all when y'all get out. Take care of yourself.
DEBBIE	What was that? What the fuck was that?
DOORMAN	It is what it is, sweetie. Now can you step to the back, please?
ALISON	You know what? Maybe we should just go.
DEBBIE	You don't need to call me sweetie.
DOORMAN	Yeah, but maybe you should listen to your friend.
DEBBIE	No, you don't need to call me sweetie.
DOORMAN	All right, you want to come in, you're going to have to go to the end of the line and wait like everybody else.
DEBBIE	I'm not going to go to the end of the fucking line. Who the fuck are you? I have just as much of a right to be here as any of these little skanky girls! What, am I not skanky enough for you?! You want me to hike up my fucking skirt?! What the fuck is your problem?! I'm not going anywhere! You're just some `roided out freak with a fucking clipboard. And your stupid little fucking rope! You may have power now, but you're not God. You're a doorman! Okay? You're a doorman! So...fuck you, you fucking fag with your fucking little faggy gloves.
DOORMAN	Come here, come on.
DOORMAN	I know. You're right. I'm so sorry. I fucking hate this job. I don't want to be the one to pass judgement and decide who gets in. This shit makes me sick to my stomach. I get the runs from the stress. It's not because you're not hot. I would love to tap that ass. I would tear that ass up. I can't let you in because you're old as fuck...for this club, not, you know, for the earth.
DEBBIE	What?
DOORMAN	You old. She pregnant. Can't have a bunch of old, pregnant bitches running around. That's crazy. I'm only allowed to let in five percent black people. He said that. Five percent. That mean if there's twenty-five people here, I get to let in one-and-a-quarter black people. So I got to hope there's a black midget in the crowd.
DEBBIE	Now I feel guilty. I'm sorry.
DOORMAN	Why y'all want to be in here anyway? Y'all need to be at a yoga class or something. What the fuck is she doing at the club? That's not even good parenting right there. Your old ass should know better than that.
DEBBIE	Oh, God. Ugh.
BEN	Have the mushrooms kicked in yet?
BEN	This was a great idea, man.
PETE	This is the best idea I've ever had in my life.
BEN	What are they going to do? What in the world are they doing? If I shaved my stomach and my chest, I would look exactly like that. Those guys are at work right now. (imitating one of the
ACROBATS)	What'd you do today? Oh, just lifted my brother.
BEN	No! Don't applaud! He'll fall! I'm freaking out right now, man!
BEN	The mushrooms are turning on me!
GIANT BABY	Papa.
BEN	I am not your papa.
BEN	I can't deal with this shit, man!
DEBBIE	It's over.
ALISON	What's over?
DEBBIE	My youth.
ALISON	Don't say that.
DEBBIE	It's true. I just want to dance. I love dancing.
ALISON	So dance.
DEBBIE	I can't dance. I'm embarrassed.
ALISON	I should be embarrassed. I'm a fucking whale and I'm trying to get into some stupid club and--
DEBBIE	You look beautiful. You're young and you're tall and you got the good lips and boobs. I'm going to be alone.
ALISON	Debbie, no, you're not.
DEBBIE	Yes, I am. Oh, God! Fucking, men! I get worse looking and he gets better looking, and it's so fucking unfair. Oh, fuck. We should go. My babysitter always gets mad when we come home past twelve. She's such a pissy little high- school cunt.
STEVE MARTIN	Let's move, gang! Come on, come on, come on! Jessica, can you get these plates and put them on the table, please?!
BEN	This isn't funny. That guy has twelve kids. It's not funny. This is sick. This is a sick movie. That's a lot of responsibility to be joking about. That's not funny. I got to turn this off. It's freaking me out.
PETE	There are five different types of chairs in this hotel room.
BEN	Holy fuck. What are they all doing in here?
PETE	These are five different types of chair.
BEN	Get them out of here, man. This is too many chairs for one room.
PETE	There's a guy that works for this hotel. His whole job is to find chairs.
PETE	Look at this one. Look at it. It's gold and red and it's kind of shiny. Shiny thread? Unbelievable. It is beautiful, and it feels amazing.
BEN	The tall one's gawking at me and the short one's being very droll. I don't like them.
PETE	Oh, wow!
BEN	It's weird that chairs even exist when you're not sitting on them.
PETE	I'm up high! I'm really high up.
BEN	I should've read the baby books.
PETE	Why didn't you read the baby books?
BEN	Because then it's real, you know?
PETE	Dude, it's real whether or not you read those books. That baby's coming.
PETE	Oh, man!
BEN	Think they'll take us back?
PETE	Yes. But I don't know why. Do you ever wonder how somebody could even like you?
BEN	All the time, man. Like every day. I wonder how you like me.
PETE	How can Debbie like me? She likes me. I mean, she loves me. The biggest problem in our marriage is that she wants me around. She loves me so much that she wants me around all the time. That's our biggest problem. And I can't even accept that? Uh, like that upsets me?!
BEN	What?
PETE	She's the one. She loves me.
BEN	You can't believe...that people love you? I love you, man! Debbie loves you!
PETE	I don't think I can accept her love. There's something wrong with me.
BEN	You can't accept love?
PETE	I don't know what it is.
BEN	Love? The most beautiful, shiny, warmy thing in the world? You can't accept it?
PETE	I have to go to this other chair.
PETE	Oh, this is a better energy.
BEN	You can't accept pure love? You can't accept Debbie? She's chosen to give you her life. She's picked you as her life partner! But you play fantasy baseball because you can't accept her love?
BEN	Ugh. I could accept it, man. And Debbie's amazing, man. She's cool and she's funny and she smells good and she's nice and her hair always looks different. She's too good for you, man.
PETE	Tastes like a rainbow.
BEN	You're disgusting. You're an urchin. And she busts your balls because you're a little bitch! You're a filthy bitch! And I'd bust your balls! Debbie wants to give her life to you and Alison doesn't want to do that with me. And it makes me sad all day. I want to go home.
PETE	(with fist in mouth) I want to go home, too.
ALISON	Everything looks beautiful.
DEBBIE	Thanks. I went kind of overboard, huh?
ALISON	No, it's great.
DEBBIE	Your daughter only turns eight once. Is Ben going to come?
ALISON	I don't think so. I don't know why he would.
BEN	Oh, hey, what up dog?
SADIE	Where have you been?
BEN	Around. You know, just kind of doing my thing.
SADIE	Why is everybody so mad at you?
BEN	I don't know. Are they mad? What have they been saying?
SADIE	They've been saying, like "blah-blah- blah-blah. Ben's a prick."
BEN	They said that?
SADIE	A lot.
BEN	That sucks.
SADIE	What does it mean?
BEN	Penis. It means penis.
SADIE	Oh. Penis.
PETE	Babe, we're running low on plates. Hey Ben! What's up, man?
BEN	What's happening, man?
DEBBIE	Hey, Ben.
BEN	Hey, Debbie.
DEBBIE	How are you?
BEN	Good. How are you?
DEBBIE	Hi. Did you just get pink cupcakes or yellow and pink cupcakes?
PETE	I just got yellow cupcakes.
DEBBIE	I thought I said to get pink cupcakes.
PETE	I can run out. I'll get some more.
DEBBIE	Nah, it's no big deal.
PETE	I don't mind.
DEBBIE	No it doesn't matter.
PETE	You sure?
DEBBIE	Yeah. You look really cute in that.
BEN	Well, that was fast, you pussy.
PETE	You're the one that got dressed up like a cholo on Easter to come to this party.
BEN	How are things at Butt-Fucking-Ham Palace?
PETE	You look like Babe Ruth's gay brother, Gabe Ruth.
BEN	Well played, sir. That was good.
PETE	You going to talk to Alison?
BEN	Yeah, I was about to.
PETE	Right on.
BEN	It's a doll.
PETE	Thanks, Ben.
ALISON	I just don't think we can make it work.
BEN	We can get back on track and everything's going to be great.
ALISON	You're just being nice. And I'm being nice and just because we're two nice people doesn't mean we should stay together. I don't want this baby to determine the rest of our lives. You know? Me not wanting to do this alone isn't enough of a reason to drag you into a relationship with me. It's just not fair. And, and don't repeat this, but, God, I don't want to end up like Debbie.
BEN	But Debbie's happy.
ALISON	She's happy today. But every day is a constant struggle for them because they're not right for each other. You know? And they have to force it and I don't want us to have to do that. I don't want to force you to be what I think you should be. That's wrong of me because you're great. You really are. You're great the way you are and, I mean, you like to get high and you like to do shrooms in Vegas.
BEN	I didn't do shrooms in Vegas.
ALISON	And who am I to stop you? Who am I to tell you that that's wrong? It's not wrong. It's who you are. It's what you enjoy and that's your life and...
BEN	I'm not that guy anymore.
ALISON	We can be friends. And you can be there when the baby is born, and in the baby's life as much as you want. I hope you will be.
BEN	If you give me a shot to just show you that I'm con--
DEBBIE	Excuse me?
BEN	Oh, shit.
DEBBIE	Can you grab the video camera? We're going to sing "Happy Birthday" now.
ALISON	Yeah. I'm sorry. I got to go. I'm sorry.
BEN	It's okay.
ALISON	I'll be right back. We'll finish talking.
PETE	What happened?
BEN	Thanks for warning me, man. I just walking into a fucking buzz saw! She rejected me! Because you, for some insane reason, told Debbie that I did mushrooms with you in Vegas! She gets mad because I smoke pot!
BEN	Now I'm upping it to fucking psychedelics! Thanks!
PETE	Really? I thought that she'd take you back.
BEN	You know why she just rejected me? Because you're such a shitty husband, she thinks I'm going to turn into a shitty husband!
PETE	"Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you."
JESSICA ALBA	When are you due?
ALISON	I got two months.
JESSICA ALBA	Really? Wow. Well, you're so big already.
ALISON	Yeah.
ANDY DICK	When is that baby popping out?
ALISON	I got two months to go.
ANDY DICK	Really? Are you dilated yet?
ALISON	Wow, wow.
EVA MENDES	You look fantastic.
ALISON	Thanks, thanks.
EVA MENDES	Are you going to, like, give birth right now?
STEVE CARELL	Wow! You're about to drop any second.
ALISON	You know what?
STEVE CARELL	I love your broach here.
ALISON	You don't need to lie to me. I don't appreciate it. I know I look like a fat cow. And I'm sweating profusely.
STEVE CARELL	No, you don't look like a...fat cow at all. You look great. So, I have to get going in. They're calling me.
ALISON	Steve, hey! Help me out. Give me an interview, please.
STEVE CARELL	Well, I just need to run in.
ALISON	You know what? Just say into the camera, "You're watching E! Entertainment." Just give me that.
STEVE CARELL	Congratulations.
ALISON	No, Steve, don't be an asshole! Come on.
STEVE CARELL	I'm not being an asshole.
BRENT	Wow. You managed to turn Steve Carell into an asshole. No easy feat.
ALISON	Shut up, Brent.
BEN	You screwed me, Dad, okay? You said everything was going to be fine and nothing is fine. Nothing is fine.
BEN	Because you were the only one giving me advice! And it was, it was terrible advice!
BEN	I don't know how to take responsibility for myself, okay? I didn't read the baby books!
BEN	I should smoke less pot. I don't know what to do! I'm an idiot! What, tell me what to do!
BEN	Just tell me what to do.
BOSS	Stone, you settling in okay?
BEN	Best job I ever had.
BOSS	Like to hear it.
JACK	Alison, thank you for coming in. I don't want to shock you, but know what's under that jacket. You're pregnant, have been for a while. From my count, you're right around eight months. And I don't know why you felt you couldn't tell us.
ALISON	I'm really sorry.
JILL	This is Hollywood. We don't like liars.
ALISON	I just wasn't expecting this and, I didn't know how to handle it, and I didn't want to lose my job. I'm really sorry.
JACK	It's unfortunate that you didn't tell us because you would've found out that we thought it's great.

JILL	I just don't like secrets.
PETE	You know, it's a rare thing that you live to see the day your wildest dreams come true. I mean what is there left to want? I get to go to Legoland.
DEBBIE	Shut up, Pete.
PETE	Say it!
ALISON	Legoland!
DEBBIE	Don't get them all riled up before the drive.
PETE	I shouldn't have given them all that meth then.
DEBBIE	We'll be back on Sunday.
PETE	Or Saturday. You never know. We might see it all in one day.
DEBBIE	Sunday. Let's go.
ALISON	Ow, ow, ow.
BEN	Hello?
JASON	Hey, what's up daddy? What are you doing?
BEN	Just smoking a joint, drinking some beers, you know. Rocking.
JASON	I think we're about to go to a new club. You coming?
BEN	No. I'm going to pack it in soon.
JONAH	What's he doing?
JASON	He says he's going to call it a night. Dude, it's like eight-fifteen, man.
BEN	I know. I'm just tired.
JONAH	Is he depressed?
JASON	You depressed?
BEN	No, I feel great. I like it.
JASON	He says no.
JONAH	Ask him if he's going to kill himself.
JASON	You going to kill yourself?
BEN	No, I'm not. Okay? Thank you.
JONAH	Tell him not to jerk off with a noose around his neck. It's dangerous.
JASON	You shouldn't jerk off with a noose around your neck because it's dangerous.
BEN	Okay, very good.
JONAH	Oh, and tell him if he has to, tell him he needs a teammate or a spotter there.
JASON	Right. And if you do, um, you should have a teammate or a spotter there.
BEN	Great.
JASON	He says your mom's already there.
JONAH	That's cool, man.
ALISON	Okay, okay, okay. (into the phone) Hi, Dr. Howard?
ALISON	I'm a patient of Dr. Howard's and I'm going into labor and I need to speak with him.
ALISON	Can you help me find him? Can you give me his number?
ALISON	No, no, no, no. I want to speak to my own doctor. You really won't give me his number? Because this is my first baby and he promised that he would be here for me and I need you to give me his number, okay?
ALISON	No, I don't want you to help me because I have no idea who you are! I want my own goddamned doctor! You make sure he calls me!
ALISON	Oh, shit. Okay. Oh, shit.
BEN	Hello?
BEN	Oh, don't run out of gas! Don't run out of gas! Come on!
BEN	Hello?
BEN	Please be in here. Hello? Hello!
BEN	Hello? Alison. Hello?
ALISON	Ben?
BEN	Alison. What is this, like a water birth? What are we doing? Should we go?
ALISON	Shh! Just relax, okay? Just be mellow, because that's what this is all about. Because if it gets too stressful in here then the baby is born into a stressful environment and then he's wired for stress for the rest of his life. So just...just be calm.
BEN	Okay. Okay. Let's relax. Do you want to talk about things? I feel really bad about a lot of the shit I did. I can't believe I said some of that. That's all I think about in my head.
IT--
ALISON	I don't want to talk about it.
BEN	But maybe we could bring the baby into a reconciled place so, we can talk--
ALISON	No. I don't want to go there. Don't go there, okay?
BEN	Okay.
ALISON	Help me stay relaxed.
BEN	So, what should I do?
ALISON	You need to call Dr. Howard.
MARIA	Hello?
BEN	Hello, this is Ben Stone. I'm calling on behalf of Alison Scott. We need Dr. Howard. It's an emergency.
MARIA	He's at San Francisco at Bar Mitzvah.
BEN	He's at a Bar Mitzvah in San Francisco? Do you know when he gets back?
MARIA	In three days.
BEN	Do you have his cell number, by any chance?
BEN	Hey! Good news. I got his number right here. I'm going to call him right now.
ALISON	Great. Thank you so much. I'm so glad you're here. Thank you.
BEN	I'm glad I'm here, too. Thank you. I shouldn't have told you you were a fucking lunatic. I shouldn't have said that. I feel terrible about it.
ALISON	No, it's okay. We're past it. I'm sorry I told you to fuck your bong.
BEN	It's okay. I didn't
ALISON	Let's just drop it now. We're over it.
BEN	I'm going to call him right now. You're doing so great.
BEN	(into the phone) Hey, Doc Howard. Ben Stone calling. Guess what the fuck's up? Alison's going into labor and you are not fucking here. Now, where are you? You're at a fucking Bar Mitzvah in San Francisco, you motherfucking piece of shit! And you know I'm going to have to do now? I'm going to have to kill you. I'm going to have to pop a cap in your ass. You're dead! You're Tupac! You are fucking Biggie, you piece of shit! I hope you fucking die or drop the fucking chair and kill that fucking kid! Hope your plane crashes. Peace, fucker!
ALISON	Hey.
BEN	Hey.
ALISON	Did you talk to him?
BEN	I didn't talk to him directly, I left him a very nice message, though. What I'm about to tell you isn't that bad. You should know that going in. We can get through this and it's just a little hiccup, but everything will be fine. Do you trust me when I say everything will be fine?

ALISON	Thank you.
BEN	You're welcome.
ALISON	Wait. Are we allowed to park here?
BEN	It's okay.
BEN	I stole this from Martin's grandma.
ALISON	Oh. That was really sweet of you.
BEN	Thanks.
BEN	We're close. Home stretch. (to Female Nurse) Hello. This is Alison Scott. Dr. Kuni said he would let you know we were coming?
FEMALE NURSE	He did. We'll take good care of you. Samuel?
SAMUEL	Yeah?
FEMALE NURSE	This is Alison Scott. Please admit her into room 307.
SAMUEL	All right. Hi.
BEN	You're our nurse?
SAMUEL	That's why I'm holding the clipboard. So, uh, what else is up with you guys?
SAMUEL	I'm just joking. Let's have a baby!
SAMUEL	So, I'm sorry it took me so long to find that vein. That little guy really didn't want me to find him.
ALISON	Is that the baby on that one right there?
SAMUEL	Yeah. That's how we can tell how the little guy or gal is doing.
ALISON	Okay.
BEN	We really, really appreciate you coming, man.
BEN	He's at a Bar Mitzvah in San Francisco. He didn't tell us though.
BEN	Yeah.
ALISON	Dr. Kuni, I really want to do this naturally. I don't want to use drugs.
SAMUEL	Four centimeters.
SAMUEL	Dilated.
JONAH	I want to get the fuck out of here.
JAY	What?
JONAH	I just want to get the fuck out of here.
JAY	Just relax, man, just relax.
JONAH	I don't fucking like hospitals.
JAY	Jonah, this is beautiful. I just think you need to relax and embrace the beauty of another life joining our gang. We're having a baby. We are having a baby.
JONAH	I'm not having shit besides a fucking panic attack. There's probably a fucking room back there full of dead bodies! You guys want to be here when one rolls out and just fucking coughs malaria into our face?
JAY	Jesus.
JONAH	Fucking shit.
BEN	Is that good?
ALISON	Oh, yeah, get in there.
BEN	I could do this all day.
ALISON	What was that?
BEN	What the hell was that?
BEN	What's that, what's happening?
SAMUEL	Decels.
BEN	It's going to be okay. (to Dr. Kuni) Is it going to be fine? You're going to feel a little bit of a push.
BEN	What are you doing?
ALISON	Oh, my God.
BEN	What?
ALISON	No, no, no, no. I don't want the baby to be born all drugged out. It's not my birth plan.
ALISON	What? No. But no, I'm not comfortable with that. I'm not.
BEN	No. Would you please just listen to her?
BEN	Whoa, whoa, whoa, what?
BEN	No. What we want is to take a second to talk about our options, okay? That's all we want.
BEN	Can we talk outside in the hall for a second?
BEN	Look, she's just having a hard time because her and her doctor had a very specific birth plan. And they wanted it to be a very special experience.
BEN	Look, man, will you help us out? I have no idea what I'm doing. You can be as big a dick to me as you want. Just be nice to her, man. That's all I ask. Just please be nice to her.
BEN	I think so.
BEN	Thank you, man.
ALISON	Whatever. Do what you have to do.
ALISON	(whispering to Ben) Oh, my God. What a nightmare that guy is.
BEN	I know, I know. Look, I talked to him. I think he'll be more cool now.
ALISON	I'm so sorry I broke up with you.
BEN	You really don't need to be. And you know, I knew you'd give me another shot. I figured it'd be a lot sooner than this, you know?
ALISON	I was just in such a panic from all of this. And watching Debbie and Pete together, and my ass got so fat.
BEN	No, no.
ALISON	It did. I just never, for one minute, thought that the guy who got me pregnant would actually be the right guy for me.
BEN	Me neither.
ALISON	I guess he is.
JONAH	All right, Martin, who am I?
(IMPERSONATING STEPHEN
HAWKING)	People think I'm smart because I speak in a robot voice.
MARTIN	Stephen Hawking.
JONAH
(IMPERSONATING STEPHEN
HAWKING)	I fuck my nurse with my ever-expanding cock. All right. Let's murderball. Come here! I'm going to murderball you!
MARTIN	Oh, fuck.
JONAH	Stay down!
MARTIN	Jonah, you shithead!
DEBBIE	Hi. I can't believe I go out of town and this happens.
ALISON	I know.
DEBBIE	I'm sorry, but I'm not going anywhere.
ALISON	Screw Legoland.
PETE	All right, how do you want this? You want this over the shoulder? I can do whatever you want. I can get in there. Kind of Spike Lee angles.
ALISON	No, you can shoot the waiting room. That would be great.
DEBBIE	Well, thank you. I've got it from here.
ALISON	Debbie.
BEN	Can I talk to you in the hall for a second?
DEBBIE	Why?
BEN	I'd like to be in there with Alison...without you.
DEBBIE	Okay. I understand how you feel, but this isn't up to you.
BEN	Look, Debbie, you are high off your ass if you think you're coming into that room. If you take one step towards that door, I will tell security there's a crazy chick in a pink dress snatching up babies. Okay? So don't even try to come into that room. That's my room now. That little area with the Pepsi machine...that's your area. My room. Your area. Stay in your area. Stay out of my room. Back the fuck off.
PETE	What are you doing here?
DEBBIE	He just kicked me out. He told me to leave. But I guess it's good, right? He said he's going to take care of her. He really seems on his game. I think he's going to be a good dad. I think I like him. Thank God.
PETE	I wish I'd gotten that on tape.
ALISON	Go! Holy shit, almighty! Oh, shit, this really hurts!
ALISON	I want the epidural! Okay? Give me the epidural!
BEN	Give it to her. Give her the epidural, okay?
ALISON	Okay?
BEN	Give it to her now.
ALISON	No, seriously, I want an epidural! I know there's time!
ALISON	Take the time! I'll make sure it doesn't come out! I'll stop pushing.
BEN	We have time.
ALISON	I'll stop, oh, please, please, please!
BEN	Just do it, please!
ALISON	Okay.
ALISON	I feel everything! Oh, my God! It's happening.
SAMUEL	Maybe we can take it down just a little. I think you're going to scare the other pregnant women.
ALISON	Are you fucking kidding me? Are you kidding me?
JAY	Jesus.
JONAH	Oh. This is messed up. Something's wrong in there.
JASON	No, no. I mean, granted, gynecology's only a hobby of mine, but it sounds to me like she's crowning. Is that right, Deb?
DEBBIE	Yeah. That's what it sounds like for everyone. Everyone goes through this.
JAY	No, I disagree with you. That sounds terrible. I'm going to go sneak a peek, see if there's anything I can do.
ALISON	Oh, God. Honey, what does it look like, Ben?
BEN	Oh, God.
ALISON	What?
BEN	You don't want to see it. You don't
WANT--
ALISON	No, I want to see it!
BEN	It's beautiful. You don't want to, though.
ALISON	No, I want to see...
ALISON	...it! Oh, God! Oh, God!
JAY	You okay in here?
JAY	Jesus!
ALISON	Get out!
JAY	Yeah, okay.
JASON	You all right, buddy?
JAY	One sec.
JONAH	What did it look like?
JAY	I shouldn't have gone in there. Don't go in there. Promise me you don't go in there.
JONAH	Me go in there? That's the last fucking place I want to go. Like I'm going to go in there. Try getting a boner now.
JASON	What's up Deb?
DEBBIE	Hey.
ALISON	Oh, God!
ALISON	Oh, Ben. I did it.
BEN	You did it.
ALISON	It's out.
BEN	You did it. Oh, my God, you did it.
ALISON	Hi, baby. I love you, Ben.
BEN	I love you so much, too. Oh, my God.
ALISON	Thank you.
ALISON	Pretty baby.
BEN	You got out. You made it out. Welcome.
MARTIN	You ever get so bored you just stare at your balls?
JONAH	I bet you do, late John Lennon.
MARTIN	Here we go again.
DEBBIE	(whispering to Pete) Who is that? Is that Ben's rabbi? Is he the one who cuts the penis?
PETE	I think it's Matisyahu.
MARTIN	Awesome.
JASON	You want out of the bet?
MARTIN	I want out of the bet.
JASON	You know what you have to say. Just say it, man. I think now is the time.
MARTIN	"Jason, you're the master."
JASON	You heard it, right?
JAY	Yeah.
JASON	All right. You're out of the bet. You're done.
JASON	Your face smells like an old man's balls.
MARTIN	Thank you.
DEBBIE	Oh, my God. Hello. My goodness. She's beautiful. She's beautiful. I love you, Ben.
BEN	I love you, Debbie.
DEBBIE	We're going to have another baby.
PETE	Okay.
DEBBIE	Hello, baby.
BEN	Gentlemen, it's a girl!
THE GUYS	Ohhhhhhh!
BEN	Yeah!
JAY	We got a daughter! Mazel Tov!
JASON	Congratulations, Daddy!
JAY	We got a beautiful little girl!
BEN	Let's meet her! She's awesome.
JAY	A beautiful little girl!
JASON	Let's meet her. Aw.
BEN	(to the baby) And then your mommy said, "Just do it, already," which was very confusing to Daddy. So I listened to the most literal translation of that and I just did it, already. What would you do? Don't tell Mommy, but it was the smartest thing I ever did, listening to her, because now you're here. Isn't that nice? I think it is.
ALISON	I hope your apartment's big enough for the three of us.
BEN	It definitely is. That's why I got one in East LA. The rent. It's huge! The only thing is we have to decide if we're going to be Crips or Bloods before we get there.
ALISON	Well, I look good in red.
BEN	I look good in blue. The fighting continues. We could just throw off everyone and become Latin Kings.
ALISON	Yeah.
BEN	We both look good in gold.
ALISON	Good choice. I would yell at you about driving so slow, except the baby's here.
BEN	No, these guys can honk all they want. I ain't going faster than twelve. It might take us around three hours to get home, though.
